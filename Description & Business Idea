Opening a new hotel, opening a new hotel in Hamburg, Germany.


Hamburg has everything, three rivers (Elbe, Alster and Bille) + two seas (North and Baltic). It has culture as a Free City and being the gateway
to the New World. Worldly cosmopolitan and diverse city, Hamburg is one of Germany's finest tourist destinations.



In this anylsis, I will get into detail where to open a new hotel. There are different aspects to consider:

  1.  Which districts are the most popular ones? The more people are visiting a district, the more popular it is and the more
      revenue we can expect.
  2.  But the more popular a district is, we can expect more competition. So, we have to consider the amount of existing hotels
      in all of the analyzed districts.
  3.  These analysis is only one step in a long journey to find the perfect place for a hotel. Therefore, I cut the district
      amount to just 15.
  4.  Using a Clustering method (k-Clustering) we build clusters. Using those clusters we decide in which we will open the
      hotel.
