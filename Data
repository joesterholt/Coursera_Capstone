Business Plan: opening a hotel in Hamburg, Germany

First:
We are using a .csv file containing all districts of Hamburg. We download it from the following source: 
http://suche.transparenz.hamburg.de/dataset/stadtteil-profile.


Second:
We are cleaning the data, constructing a data frame. Using the district names, 
we use the package geopy.geocoders to get the longitude and latitude values for each district. 
In order to keep the analysis short, we are just using the first 15 districts from our created data frame.

Third:
Using the created data frame, we use the Foursquare API (https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/data)
in order to get data for the top venues in the different districts.
Using the top venues we can analyze which district are the most popular and which districts have the most competition and
ultimately we can say in which district we have the best chances for opening our new hotel.
